# Numpy - Numerical Python

Numpy is funadamental package for numerical computations in python.

NumPy is a Python library for creating and manipulating vectors and matrices.

Support different datatypes.

Supports N-dimensional array objects that can be used for processing  multi-dimensional data.

Using Numpy we can perform:-

1) Mathematical and logical operations on arrays

2) Fourier transforms

3) Linera Algebra operations

Advantages of Numpy

1) Numpy supports vectorized operations.

2) Numpy is faster than operations carried out on python lists. 

3) Numpy use less memory in runtime than python list.
